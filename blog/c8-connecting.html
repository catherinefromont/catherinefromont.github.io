    <p><strong>Have you tried using any of the insight and techniques for growing trust and sincerity? How did it go?</strong></p>

    <p>Well, if I show empathy for others and they show empathy towards me, I feel as though there is definitely a trust that is built. I haven't used any of these techniques in the book yet but I will definitely practice them.</p>

    <p><strong>Try empathic listening - how did it go?</strong></p>

      <p>I have always tried to be an empathetic listener - if people feel a certain way I try to instinctively respond to them with kindness and I do try to have an automatic perception of others being “just like me.” I think everyone should try to be more empathetic towards others at time - and listening to others is hugely important also.</p>

    <p><strong>How did you find the loving kindness meditation?</strong></p>

      <p>I loved it! I did it myself, then did it with my sister. It makes your soul feel so good!</p>

    <p><strong>Complete the political awareness exercise here in writing.</strong></p>

    <p>Well, this weekend my mum is taking myself and my two siblings away on holiday for a week. She feels as though the other two don't appreciate what shes done for them, shes spent time and money prepping this awesome holiday for us, and my brother has taking 4 days of it by inviting 4 friends around, and my sister wants to go out every night. Now I looked at this situation from my mums perspective, and from my perspective. I talked to my siblings about how mum would be feeling because of the way they are treating her, and I told them to try and put themselves in her position - and imagine how she must be feeling. I did that and it was a huge wake up call. For them it was too. That showed Political Awareness on my behalf and the conflict was resolved shortly after doing this exercise.</p>
