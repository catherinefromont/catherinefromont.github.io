    <p><strong>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</strong></p>

      <p>Self awareness is the way we are able to reflect on our own emotional standings, whereas mindfulness is having the ability of pay attention and take action on your emotions in order for you to be able to show self awareness and reflect upon them. They are very similar, but help each other out to become one.</p>

    <p><strong>Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel?</strong></p>

      <p>I have always had a journal, I dont write in it nearly as much anymore as I used to - so seeing this was a good and important reminder as to just how useful it is to write down your emotions. I always found it took a weight off my shoulders being able to physically get my feelings and emotions out on paper.</p>

    <p><strong>What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?</strong></p>

      <p>The idea that your emotions are not who you are is fairly obvious because we know our emotions are never permanent and constantly changing so it doesn't make sense for your emotions to be able to define YOU as a person.</p>
