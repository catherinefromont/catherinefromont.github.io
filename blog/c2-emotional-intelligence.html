<h1>Emotional Intelligence</h1>

<div>

    <p><strong>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</p></strong>
    <p>I hadn't really ever heard of Emotional Intelligence until reading about this, I realy loved the way they defined it when they said Emotional Intelligence is “The ability to monitor one’s own and others’ feelings and emotions, to discriminate among them and to use this information to guide one’s thinking and actions.”.
      Self Awareness, Self Regulation, Motivation, Empathy, and Social Skills are all such a massive part of our Emotional Intelligence and I learnt so much about each one of these aspects. I definitely need to work on these in order to better myself.</p>


    <p><strong>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</p></strong>
    <p>I personally found it really interesting and relatable, because in my own experience and hardship I had to learn to be mindful... so practicing this isn't new to me. I try to be mindful and slow down from all the things I have going on in my life and try to ground myself. Being mindful and meditating every so often has really taught me so much and made me a better person without a doubt. Knowing how to be mindful is so important.</p>
