    <p>Great so far!</p>


    <p><strong>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</strong></p>
    <p>I am coming into this with an  open mind, not knowing what to expect but I will engage to the best of my ability.</p>


    <p><strong>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</strong></p>
    <p>Yes! Its better than I expected!</p>


    <p><strong>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</strong></p>
