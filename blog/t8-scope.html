    <p><strong>Scope</strong></p>

    <p>In JavaScript there are two types of scope - theres a Local Scope and a Global Scope. Javascipt has a function scope,
      where each function creates a new scope that determines the accessibility of these variables. But those variables defined inside a function
      aren't accessible from the outside of the function.</p>

    <p><strong>Global Scope</strong></p>

      <p>Variables that are declared outside a Javascript function, becomes Global. A global variable has global scope so this means that all scripts and functions on a web page can access it.</p>

    <p><strong>Local Scope</strong></p>

      <p>Variables that are declared within a JavaScript function, are classified Local to the function. Local variables have local scope where they can only be accessed within the function.</p>
