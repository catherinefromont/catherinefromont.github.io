    <p><strong>What is your experience of compassionate (or not) leadership?</strong></p>

    <p>I personally have never been a strong leader - but I have most definitely come across a few compassionate leaders. There was a girl who I went to high school who ended up getting head girl in our last year of school because she was a compassionate leader and deserved it. She wasn't just any ordinary leader - she didn't have favourites and she was friends with absolutely everyone, and no one ever said a bad word about her. She was an academic and an athlete, religious and musical. She had it all, but she was always so incredibly humble and lead our year group better than anyone could imagine, she always put everyone else first and no matter how busy she was she would still take time out to help others. To me, that is what I consider a compassionate leader.</p>

    <p><strong>Do the multiplying goodness meditation. How did you find it?</strong></p>

      <p>I found it super uplifiting and instantantiously made me feel more positive although it wasn't exactly realistic because sometimes when you are down its hard to just switch to being positive. I will definitely try this when I am feeling down or stressed.</p>

    <p><strong>Do the Tonglen meditation. How did you find it?</strong></p>

      <p>I personally think this was more realistic than the Goodness meditation because it lets you accept your struggles and look at them from the outside, then allows us to transform them into positivity. I like being able to accept my struggles rather than pretend they dont exist.</p>

    <p><strong>How does the SCARF model apply to your Phase 0 experience so far? How will it apply to bootcamp?</strong></p>

      <p>I think it is really applying to my experience well, in all aspects I feel like I have so much support, and certainty I think that it will really slot in well with bootcamp when we are all in the same position and needing to support each other. </p>

    <p><strong>Have a difficult conversation. How did it go? (It's a valuable skill, but can take practice to develop!)</p></strong>

      <p>I am the eldest child in my family, I have 2 younger siblings. For those that know what its like to be an eldest child I think they will know it comes with alot of responsibility. I have a puppy who can't come with me when I move to AKL for Bootcamp and I will be leaving lots of responsibilities behind when I move away. for me that was a difficult conversation to have with my sister because she will be in a position where she needs to step up and take on the responisbilities I will be leaving behind. I have total faith in her but I did feel alot of guilt. I am slowly learning how to cope in difficult conversations and how to approach them.</p>
