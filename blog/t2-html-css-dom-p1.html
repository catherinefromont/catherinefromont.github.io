<p><strong>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?</strong></p>
  <p>HTML is the basic technical side to coding - like a foundation or something to build off. CSS is the design and decorative side to coding, where you're able to make the foundation/base look appealing and creative. the DOM is like these two together, where all of the HTML and CSS is found.</p>

<p><strong>What is meant by boxifying design?</p></strong>
  <p>Boxifying design is basically an invisible grid structure on your website so you can align different design elements to make them fit together on the page for the overall look.</p>

<p><strong>What is the box model?</p></strong>
  <p>Each element on a website is in a box. The box is made up of Content (text), Padding (the transparent area that surrounds the content), Border (border around the content and padding), and Margin (thetransparent area around the border).
