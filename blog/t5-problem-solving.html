<h1>T5 Problem Solving Blog</h1>

    <p><strong>What was the problem?</strong></p>
    <p>Syntax errors!! I would get them constantly, but find it so difficult to fix them.</p>
    <p><strong>What problem solving techniques did you use?</strong></p>
    <p>I broke down the error, figuring out exactly where abouts in my code I had gone wrong, then read over it to make sure I had everything correct. I would try adding things or taking things away until the error was fixed.</p>
    <p><strong>How did you feel throughout the process?</strong></p>
    <p>Frustrated, useless and upset when it didnt go right - but when it did work I felt on top of the world, and I felt like I could do anything!</p>
    <p><strong>What did you learn?</strong></p>
    <p>Be patient with yourself, take time to slowly and carefully go over these things, the more you rush the harder it is to pick up on these errors, and its generally why you make mistakes in the first place - if you're always rushing.</p>

    <p><strong>Pseudocode</strong></p>
    <p>It is a text-based method for preparing the code that you want to create. It's written in English, but its a useful tool to give you step by step to give you the result you want.
      I use this form of problem solving because it helps prevent creating a problem in the first place.</p>
    <p><strong>Trying something</strong></p>
    <p>The easiest way of problem solving - if it doesn't work, go back and try something different.</p>
    <p><strong>Rubber ducky method</strong></p>
    <p>I haven't used this method before and don't really understand it.</p>
    <p><strong>Reading error messages</strong></p>
    <p>That has been my weakness so far, but breaking down the error and starting from the beginning going over your code is a good way of solving these issues.</p>
    <p><strong>Console.logging</strong></p>
    <p>Helps alot to visually see whats going on and whether the outputted code is doing the correct thing.</p>
    <p><strong>Googling</strong></p>
    <p>Helpful, but feel like I am cheating in some ways by using google.</p>
    <p><strong>Asking your peers for help</strong></p>
    <p>Always good to get fresh and different ideas, problem solving techniques and help from peers, gives you different ways of looking at the problems.</p>
    <p><strong>Asking coaches for help</strong></p>
    <p>Always a good thing to do if you're stuck - thats what they are there for - to teach and help us.</p>
    <p><strong>Improving your process with reflection</strong></p>
    <p>Hugely important, to understand what you're doing well, or not so well, and reflect on ways you can improve.</p>

    <p><strong>.map()</strong></p>
    <p>When the .map function is called on an array it creates a new array made up of the results of a chosen function on each element of the parent array.</p>
    <p><strong>.filter()</strong></p>
    <p>Creates a new array of all the elements in the parent array which comply to the conditions set out in the function within the filter parameters.</p>
    <p><strong>.reduce()</strong></p>
    <p>Reduces the values of an array to a single value. It uses two parameters and then a function to return the single value. This can also be used to flatten an array of arrays into a single array.</p>
