    <p><strong>What a responsive site is, and why responsiveness is important.</strong></p>

    <p>A responsive webpage can be viewed on different screen sizes or and is adaptive to any browser it is being viewed on. The webpage is formatted in a way that when viewing on smaller or bigger screens, the webpage is able to adapt which is really important nowadays with so many people using smartphones etc.</p>

     <p><strong>What mobile first design is, and why it's important.</strong></p>

     <p>Mobile first is an approach to responsive design: design for smaller screens first, then add more features and content for bigger and bigger screens. This design approach is also known as "progressive enhancement."</p>

     <p><strong>What frameworks are, and their pros and cons.</strong></p>

     <p>Frameworks are awesome, they make building and coding websites SO much easier, because instead of starting on a blank canvas you have something to go off. The cons are that if you dont like certain things about the framework it can be difficult to change them.</p>

     <p><strong>What a wireframe is and why we use it.</strong></p>

     <p>A wireframe is a basic sketch of what we want our website to look like - without all the pretty colours and styling - it focuses more on sizing, layout and its a good way to use the grid and columns.</p>
