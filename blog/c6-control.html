    <p><strong>When programming, what are some of your triggers? What causes a disproportionate emotional response?</strong></p>

      <p>I find I get triggered when I come across certain code I have struggled with in the past, errors and functions that I still haven't quite figured out how to do. When this happens I tend to panic, and not look at the bigger picture - that the solution to te problem may be easy to find, but because I work myself up so much it makes it difficult to look at the situation rationally.
      Therefore, a disproportionate emotional response occurs - where I over analyse the situation, making it bigger than it needs to be - "making a mountain out of a molehill" scenario.</p>

    <p><strong>How did you find the Siberian North Railroad exercise (Stop, Breathe, Notice, Reflect, Respond)?</strong></p>

      <p>I thought it was awesome! interesting name for it though, but very very useful! It  stops me from panicing when something goes wrong and teaches me to stop and re-assess the situation. </p>
