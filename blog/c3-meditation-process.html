<h1>C3 Meditation Process</h1>

    <p><strong>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</strong></p>

      <p>Well as people will see on my website, I don't think I could've followed it any better. My website is clean and simple, its responsive on mobiles and user friendly.</p>

    <p><strong>What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2?</strong></p>

      <p>I always have considered Meditation to be an important exercise to maintain mindfulness and be able to stay grounded etc.</p>

    <p><strong>What new things have you learnt about meditation?</strong></p>

      <p>That we should treat meditation with the same importance as we consider physical exercise like going for a run etc, because your mental and spiritual aspect is just as important to look after.</p>

    <p><strong>Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?</strong></p>

      <p>Nothing new really, to me, meditation isn't complex, and the way it was outlined in the novel is the way I tend to meditate.</p>

    <p><strong>Any other musings?</strong></p>

      <p>No not really.</p>
