    <p><strong>What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it?</strong></p>

      <p>I learnt that if I allow myself to really focus on listening to what the other person is saying I am actually really good at it, and it helps me to engage more with the conversation I am having with that person. I did this task with my sister, who finds it hard to stop and really listen as well. With us both being girls, we tend to talk alot, so our conversations can be really full on, and not much time spared to actually stop and listen to what the other person is saying. She really engaged with the conversation just like me and I think it has made us better off for our future conversations.</p>

    <p><strong>Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</strong></p>

      <p>I think all of them are really helpful but I think I will stick to mostly taking mindful breaths each day. I already do this a lot but I know it works really well for me, so I will continue to do it. </p>

    <p><strong>Any other musings?</strong></p>

      <p>No not really. I really enjoyed that chapter though!</p>
