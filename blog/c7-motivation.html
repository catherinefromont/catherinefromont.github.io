    <p><strong>How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?</strong></p>
    <p>Positive, and its an awesome way to look at life and what you decide to do with it.. making decisions around passion, pleasure and purpose instead of envy and greed for example is more likely to make us happier. For example, I always told myself I wanted to be a lawyer before I got into this, I thought about it because i thought i was good at English and History through school and it would be a good fit and I liked the money side of it to - being a lawyer and earning the big bucks. But deep down I knew it wasn't my passion, it didn't give me pleasure and it certainly didn't give me purpose. Now I have found Web Development, I made this decision because it is my passion, and it is pleasureable and rewarding, and if I have these two feelings I believe I have purpose also - because I am happy.</p>
    <p><strong>From the 'discovering values and higher purpose' exercise:</strong></p>
    <p><strong>What are your core values?</strong></p>
    <p><ul>
    <li>Respect</li>
    <li>Honesty/Trust</li>
    <li>Kindness</li>
    <li>Self Worth</li>
    <li>Integrity</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p><strong>What do you stand for?</strong></p>
    <p><ul>
    <li>Mindfulness and Meditation</li>
    <li>Equality</li>
    <li>Looking after our Environment</li>
    </ul></p>
    <p><strong>How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?</strong></p>
    <p>I found the resilience exercise was a really good idea, but for me personally when I have failures I tend to use them as learning lessons in regards to looking at them as something I should be dwelling on or disappointed in. But each to their own. </p>
    <p><strong>Any other Musings?</strong></p>
    <p>No, I really enjoyed that chapter though!</p>
