    <p><strong>How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS?</strong></p>

      <p>JavaScript works alongside HTML and CSS to basically make a website come alive in a sense - it allows you to add cool features and widgets etc, unlike CSS which is just styling.</p>

    <p><strong>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'.</strong></p>

      <p>Control flow is the order in which the functions and/or instructions are undertaken. JavaScript carries this out as it is written. Loops are a segment of the code that is continously repeated (hence the name loop) until an action is completed.</p>

    <p><strong>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</strong></p>

      <p>Data that is stored in arrays are organised in a list-like structure. In order to access data from an array you can use the position of the list like a 'key', with the stored data being the 'value'. Objects are similar to lists, but instead they store data and functions. In order to access the data in an object you use key-value pairings using a variable name assigned by you.</p>
    <p><strong>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</strong></p>

        <p>Functions are useful because they not only accept data, and undergo an action that the data instructs, it will also return a result.</p>
