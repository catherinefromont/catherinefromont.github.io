    <p><strong>In the JavaScript language, describe all the use cases for each of:</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Parentheses () - e.g. '1. Execute a function var result = doSomething()':</strong></p>
    <p>Parentheses are most commonly used when you are wanting to pass information into a function, or to provide information to loops (for, while) and conditionals (if, else if).</p>
    <p><strong>Brackets []:</strong></p>
    <p>Square brackets are used to index (access) elements in arrays and also Strings.</p>
    <p><strong>Braces {}:</strong></p>
    <p>The curly braces are used to define the start and end of the function, they also separate code into blocks within the function. The curly braces help JavaScript to understand the structure of our script and what we want it to do. They are used with many different things including classes, functions, loops, and conditionals.</p>
    <p><strong>single quotes '':</strong></p>
    <p>JavaScript adopted the use of single quotes in code, allowing for the insertion of double quotes on attributes of appended HTML snippets. But there isn't much difference between the use of Single and Double quotation marks.</p>
    <p><strong>double quotes "":</strong></p>
    <p>HTML adopted using double quotes in HTML attributes. You can use either single or double. When referencing attributes and strings in code we use quotation marks.</p>
