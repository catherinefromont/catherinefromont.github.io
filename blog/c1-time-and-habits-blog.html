    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <h3>17 July 2017</h3>


    <p><strong>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</strong></p>
    <p>I always try my best to be mindful and the Pomodoro technique. But I tend to spend half an hour focussing and then having a break and repeat that. Helps me focus so much.</p>


    <p><strong>What did you find interesting?</strong></p>
    <p>How many different techniques there are and how some work for some people but not for others</p>


    <p><strong>What worked for you?</strong></p>
    <p>Pomodoro technique.</p>


    <p><strong>Which will you experiment further with?</strong></p>
    <p>Maybe I will try some forms of meditation, to help me unwind when I am stressed. </p>
