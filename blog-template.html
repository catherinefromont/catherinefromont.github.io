        <p><strong>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</strong></p>
        <p>I think its awesome, different and I hope it takes off and more and more people get on board with the way EDA/DBC does things.</p>


        <p><strong>What are your impressions?</strong></p>
        <p>Great so far!</p>


        <p><strong>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</strong></p>
        <p>I am coming into this with an  open mind, not knowing what to expect but I will engage to the best of my ability.</p>


        <p><strong>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</strong></p>
        <p>Yes! Its better than I expected!</p>


        <p><strong>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</strong></p>
        <p>Yes I want to challenge myself and i think that developing the skills to learn in different ways will make me more adaptable if I am ever thrown into an unfamiliar environment. I am excited!!</p>

      <h5>C1 Time and Habits Blog</h5>
      <p><strong>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</strong></p>
      <p>I always try my best to be mindful and the Pomodoro technique. But I tend to spend half an hour focussing and then having a break and repeat that. Helps me focus so much.</p>


      <p><strong>What did you find interesting?</strong></p>
      <p>How many different techniques there are and how some work for some people but not for others</p>


      <p><strong>What worked for you?</strong></p>
      <p>Pomodoro technique.</p>


      <p><strong>Which will you experiment further with?</strong></p>
      <p>Maybe I will try some forms of meditation, to help me unwind when I am stressed. </p>

      <h5>C2 Emotional Intelligence Blog</h5>
      <p><strong>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</strong></p>
      <p>I hadn't really ever heard of Emotional Intelligence until reading about this, I realy loved the way they defined it when they said Emotional Intelligence is “The ability to monitor one’s own and others’ feelings and emotions, to discriminate among them and to use this information to guide one’s thinking and actions.”.
        Self Awareness, Self Regulation, Motivation, Empathy, and Social Skills are all such a massive part of our Emotional Intelligence and I learnt so much about each one of these aspects. I definitely need to work on these in order to better myself.</p>

      <p><strong>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</strong></p>
      <p>I personally found it really interesting and relatable, because in my own experience and hardship I had to learn to be mindful... so practicing this isn't new to me. I try to be mindful and slow down from all the things I have going on in my life and try to ground myself. Being mindful and meditating every so often has really taught me so much and made me a better person without a doubt. Knowing how to be mindful is so important.</p>

      <h5>T2 HTML, CSS, and DOM Part 1 Blog</h5>
      <p><strong>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?</strong></p>
        <p>HTML is the basic technical side to coding - like a foundation or something to build off. CSS is the design and decorative side to coding, where you're able to make the foundation/base look appealing and creative. the DOM is like these two together, where all of the HTML and CSS is found.</p>

      <p><strong>What is meant by boxifying design?</strong></p>
        <p>Boxifying design is basically an invisible grid structure on your website so you can align different design elements to make them fit together on the page for the overall look.</p>

      <p><strong>What is the box model?</strong></p>
        <p>Each element on a website is in a box. The box is made up of Content (text), Padding (the transparent area that surrounds the content), Border (border around the content and padding), and Margin (thetransparent area around the border).

      <h5>T2 HTML, CSS, and DOM Part 2 Blog</h5>
      <p><strong>What is grid based design??</strong></p>

        <p>Grid based design is a useful tool to organise and structure your website, based on rows and columns. There are 12 columns on a page and a row with the width of 100%.</p>

      <p><strong>What is the hype about responsive webpages??</strong></p>

        <p>Nowadays, with more people using smart phones, and tablets etc; responsive webpages are a must have. A responsive webpage can be viewed on different screen sizes or and is adaptive to any browser it is being viewed on. The webpage is formatted in a way that when viewing on smaller or bigger screens, the webpage is able to adapt.</p>

      <p><strong>What is semantic structure?</strong></p>

        <p>A semantic structure is the foundation of your code - a template. It helps the web browser define what the layout of the content is on the webpage - whether its an image, text, or a heading etc.</p>

      <h5>C3 Meditation Process Blog</h5>
      <p><strong>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</strong></p>

        <p>Well as people will see on my website, I don't think I could've followed it any better. My website is clean and simple, its responsive on mobiles and user friendly.</p>

      <p><strong>What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2?</strong></p>

        <p>I always have considered Meditation to be an important exercise to maintain mindfulness and be able to stay grounded etc.</p>

      <p><strong>What new things have you learnt about meditation?</strong></p>

        <p>That we should treat meditation with the same importance as we consider physical exercise like going for a run etc, because your mental and spiritual aspect is just as important to look after.</p>

      <p><strong>Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?</strong></p>

        <p>Nothing new really, to me, meditation isn't complex, and the way it was outlined in the novel is the way I tend to meditate.</p>

      <p><strong>Any other musings?</strong></p>

        <p>No not really.</p>

      <h5>T3 Design To Web Blog</h5>
      <p><strong>What a responsive site is, and why responsiveness is important.</strong></p>

      <p>A responsive webpage can be viewed on different screen sizes or and is adaptive to any browser it is being viewed on. The webpage is formatted in a way that when viewing on smaller or bigger screens, the webpage is able to adapt which is really important nowadays with so many people using smartphones etc.</p>

       <p><strong>What mobile first design is, and why it's important.</strong></p>

       <p>Mobile first is an approach to responsive design: design for smaller screens first, then add more features and content for bigger and bigger screens. This design approach is also known as "progressive enhancement."</p>

       <p><strong>What frameworks are, and their pros and cons.</strong></p>

       <p>Frameworks are awesome, they make building and coding websites SO much easier, because instead of starting on a blank canvas you have something to go off. The cons are that if you dont like certain things about the framework it can be difficult to change them.</p>

       <p><strong>What a wireframe is and why we use it.</strong></p>

       <p>A wireframe is a basic sketch of what we want our website to look like - without all the pretty colours and styling - it focuses more on sizing, layout and its a good way to use the grid and columns.</p>

       <p><strong>The aspects of your wireframes you found difficult to implement, and why.</strong></p>

       <p>My wireframes were super basic so I didn't really find any of it difficult to implement.</p>

      <h5>C4 Daily Mindfulness Blog</h5>
      <p><strong>What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it?</strong></p>

        <p>I learnt that if I allow myself to really focus on listening to what the other person is saying I am actually really good at it, and it helps me to engage more with the conversation I am having with that person. I did this task with my sister, who finds it hard to stop and really listen as well. With us both being girls, we tend to talk alot, so our conversations can be really full on, and not much time spared to actually stop and listen to what the other person is saying. She really engaged with the conversation just like me and I think it has made us better off for our future conversations.</p>

      <p><strong>Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</strong></p>

        <p>I think all of them are really helpful but I think I will stick to mostly taking mindful breaths each day. I already do this a lot but I know it works really well for me, so I will continue to do it. </p>

      <p><strong>Any other musings?</strong></p>

        <p>No not really. I really enjoyed that chapter though!</p>

      <h5>T4 Javascript Basics Blog</h5>

          <p><strong>How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS?</strong></p>

            <p>JavaScript works alongside HTML and CSS to basically make a website come alive in a sense - it allows you to add cool features and widgets etc, unlike CSS which is just styling.</p>

          <p><strong>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'.</strong></p>

            <p>Control flow is the order in which the functions and/or instructions are undertaken. JavaScript carries this out as it is written. Loops are a segment of the code that is continously repeated (hence the name loop) until an action is completed.</p>

          <p><strong>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</strong></p>

            <p>Data that is stored in arrays are organised in a list-like structure. In order to access data from an array you can use the position of the list like a 'key', with the stored data being the 'value'. Objects are similar to lists, but instead they store data and functions. In order to access the data in an object you use key-value pairings using a variable name assigned by you.</p>
          <p><strong>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</strong></p>

              <p>Functions are useful because they not only accept data, and undergo an action that the data instructs, it will also return a result.</p>

      <h5>C5 Self Confidence Blog</h5>

      <p><strong>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</strong></p>

        <p>Self awareness is the way we are able to reflect on our own emotional standings, whereas mindfulness is having the ability of pay attention and take action on your emotions in order for you to be able to show self awareness and reflect upon them. They are very similar, but help each other out to become one.</p>

      <p><strong>Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel?</strong></p>

        <p>I have always had a journal, I dont write in it nearly as much anymore as I used to - so seeing this was a good and important reminder as to just how useful it is to write down your emotions. I always found it took a weight off my shoulders being able to physically get my feelings and emotions out on paper.</p>

      <p><strong>What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?</strong></p>

        <p>The idea that your emotions are not who you are is fairly obvious because we know our emotions are never permanent and constantly changing so it doesn't make sense for your emotions to be able to define YOU as a person.</p>

      <h5>T5 Problem Solving Blog</h5>
      <p><strong>What was the problem?</strong></p>
      <p>Syntax errors!! I would get them constantly, but find it so difficult to fix them.</p>
      <p><strong>What problem solving techniques did you use?</strong></p>
      <p>I broke down the error, figuring out exactly where abouts in my code I had gone wrong, then read over it to make sure I had everything correct. I would try adding things or taking things away until the error was fixed.</p>
      <p><strong>How did you feel throughout the process?</strong></p>
      <p>Frustrated, useless and upset when it didnt go right - but when it did work I felt on top of the world, and I felt like I could do anything!</p>
      <p><strong>What did you learn?</strong></p>
      <p>Be patient with yourself, take time to slowly and carefully go over these things, the more you rush the harder it is to pick up on these errors, and its generally why you make mistakes in the first place - if you're always rushing.</p>

      <p><strong>Pseudocode</strong></p>
      <p>It is a text-based method for preparing the code that you want to create. It's written in English, but its a useful tool to give you step by step to give you the result you want.
        I use this form of problem solving because it helps prevent creating a problem in the first place.</p>
      <p><strong>Trying something</strong></p>
      <p>The easiest way of problem solving - if it doesn't work, go back and try something different.</p>
      <p><strong>Rubber ducky method</strong></p>
      <p>I haven't used this method before and don't really understand it.</p>
      <p><strong>Reading error messages</strong></p>
      <p>That has been my weakness so far, but breaking down the error and starting from the beginning going over your code is a good way of solving these issues.</p>
      <p><strong>Console.logging</strong></p>
      <p>Helps alot to visually see whats going on and whether the outputted code is doing the correct thing.</p>
      <p><strong>Googling</strong></p>
      <p>Helpful, but feel like I am cheating in some ways by using google.</p>
      <p><strong>Asking your peers for help</strong></p>
      <p>Always good to get fresh and different ideas, problem solving techniques and help from peers, gives you different ways of looking at the problems.</p>
      <p><strong>Asking coaches for help</strong></p>
      <p>Always a good thing to do if you're stuck - thats what they are there for - to teach and help us.</p>
      <p><strong>Improving your process with reflection</strong></p>
      <p>Hugely important, to understand what you're doing well, or not so well, and reflect on ways you can improve.</p>

      <p><strong>.map()</strong></p>
      <p>When the .map function is called on an array it creates a new array made up of the results of a chosen function on each element of the parent array.</p>
      <p><strong>.filter()</strong></p>
      <p>Creates a new array of all the elements in the parent array which comply to the conditions set out in the function within the filter parameters.</p>
      <p><strong>.reduce()</strong></p>
      <p>Reduces the values of an array to a single value. It uses two parameters and then a function to return the single value. This can also be used to flatten an array of arrays into a single array.</p>

      <h5>T6 Javascript Language Blog</h5>
      <p><strong>In the JavaScript language, describe all the use cases for each of:</strong></p>

      <p><strong>Parentheses () - e.g. '1. Execute a function var result = doSomething()':</strong></p>
      <p>Parentheses are most commonly used when you are wanting to pass information into a function, or to provide information to loops (for, while) and conditionals (if, else if).</p>
      <p><strong>Brackets []:</strong></p>
      <p>Square brackets are used to index (access) elements in arrays and also Strings.</p>
      <p><strong>Braces {}:</strong></p>
      <p>The curly braces are used to define the start and end of the function, they also separate code into blocks within the function. The curly braces help JavaScript to understand the structure of our script and what we want it to do. They are used with many different things including classes, functions, loops, and conditionals.</p>
      <p><strong>single quotes '':</strong></p>
      <p>JavaScript adopted the use of single quotes in code, allowing for the insertion of double quotes on attributes of appended HTML snippets. But there isn't much difference between the use of Single and Double quotation marks.</p>
      <p><strong>double quotes "":</strong></p>
      <p>HTML adopted using double quotes in HTML attributes. You can use either single or double. When referencing attributes and strings in code we use quotation marks.</p>
