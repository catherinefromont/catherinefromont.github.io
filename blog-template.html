        <p><strong>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</strong></p>
        <p>I think its awesome, different and I hope it takes off and more and more people get on board with the way EDA/DBC does things.</p>


        <p><strong>What are your impressions?</strong></p>
        <p>Great so far!</p>


        <p><strong>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</strong></p>
        <p>I am coming into this with an  open mind, not knowing what to expect but I will engage to the best of my ability.</p>


        <p><strong>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</strong></p>
        <p>Yes! Its better than I expected!</p>


        <p><strong>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</strong></p>
        <p>Yes I want to challenge myself and i think that developing the skills to learn in different ways will make me more adaptable if I am ever thrown into an unfamiliar environment. I am excited!!</p>

      <h5>C1 Time and Habits Blog</h5>
      <p><strong>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</strong></p>
      <p>I always try my best to be mindful and the Pomodoro technique. But I tend to spend half an hour focussing and then having a break and repeat that. Helps me focus so much.</p>


      <p><strong>What did you find interesting?</strong></p>
      <p>How many different techniques there are and how some work for some people but not for others</p>


      <p><strong>What worked for you?</strong></p>
      <p>Pomodoro technique.</p>


      <p><strong>Which will you experiment further with?</strong></p>
      <p>Maybe I will try some forms of meditation, to help me unwind when I am stressed. </p>

      <p>My name is Catherine Fromont, I am 20 years old and currently studying here at Dev Academy! I am based in Cambridge in the Waikato at the moment working as a Calf Rearer on a farm full time, but when I do get time off I am studying. I was born in Australia, grew up there until I was 12 and then moved back to New Zealand. My family lived on a dairy farm over there, so now working on a farm is awesome.
      I have recently just completed a Diploma in Web Development and Design, so this isn't my first time coding. I really enjoy it!! Looking forward to meeting you all in January. </p>
