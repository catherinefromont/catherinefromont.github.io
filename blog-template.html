        <h5>C1 Reflection Blog</h5>
        <p><strong>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</strong></p>
        <p>I think its awesome, different and I hope it takes off and more and more people get on board with the way EDA/DBC does things.</p>


        <p><strong>What are your impressions?</strong></p>
        <p>Great so far!</p>


        <p><strong>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</strong></p>
        <p>I am coming into this with an  open mind, not knowing what to expect but I will engage to the best of my ability.</p>


        <p><strong>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</strong></p>
        <p>Yes! Its better than I expected!</p>


        <p><strong>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</strong></p>
        <p>Yes I want to challenge myself and i think that developing the skills to learn in different ways will make me more adaptable if I am ever thrown into an unfamiliar environment. I am excited!!</p>

      <h5>C1 Time and Habits Blog</h5>
      <p><strong>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</strong></p>
      <p>I always try my best to be mindful and the Pomodoro technique. But I tend to spend half an hour focussing and then having a break and repeat that. Helps me focus so much.</p>


      <p><strong>What did you find interesting?</strong></p>
      <p>How many different techniques there are and how some work for some people but not for others</p>


      <p><strong>What worked for you?</strong></p>
      <p>Pomodoro technique.</p>


      <p><strong>Which will you experiment further with?</strong></p>
      <p>Maybe I will try some forms of meditation, to help me unwind when I am stressed. </p>

      <h5>C2 Emotional Intelligence Blog</h5>
      <p><strong>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</strong></p>
      <p>I hadn't really ever heard of Emotional Intelligence until reading about this, I realy loved the way they defined it when they said Emotional Intelligence is “The ability to monitor one’s own and others’ feelings and emotions, to discriminate among them and to use this information to guide one’s thinking and actions.”.
        Self Awareness, Self Regulation, Motivation, Empathy, and Social Skills are all such a massive part of our Emotional Intelligence and I learnt so much about each one of these aspects. I definitely need to work on these in order to better myself.</p>

      <p><strong>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</strong></p>
      <p>I personally found it really interesting and relatable, because in my own experience and hardship I had to learn to be mindful... so practicing this isn't new to me. I try to be mindful and slow down from all the things I have going on in my life and try to ground myself. Being mindful and meditating every so often has really taught me so much and made me a better person without a doubt. Knowing how to be mindful is so important.</p>

      <h5>T2 HTML, CSS, and DOM Part 1 Blog</h5>
      <p><strong>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?</strong></p>
        <p>HTML is the basic technical side to coding - like a foundation or something to build off. CSS is the design and decorative side to coding, where you're able to make the foundation/base look appealing and creative. the DOM is like these two together, where all of the HTML and CSS is found.</p>

      <p><strong>What is meant by boxifying design?</strong></p>
        <p>Boxifying design is basically an invisible grid structure on your website so you can align different design elements to make them fit together on the page for the overall look.</p>

      <p><strong>What is the box model?</strong></p>
        <p>Each element on a website is in a box. The box is made up of Content (text), Padding (the transparent area that surrounds the content), Border (border around the content and padding), and Margin (thetransparent area around the border).

      <h5>T2 HTML, CSS, and DOM Part 2 Blog</h5>
      <p><strong>What is grid based design??</strong></p>

        <p>Grid based design is a useful tool to organise and structure your website, based on rows and columns. There are 12 columns on a page and a row with the width of 100%.</p>

      <p><strong>What is the hype about responsive webpages??</strong></p>

        <p>Nowadays, with more people using smart phones, and tablets etc; responsive webpages are a must have. A responsive webpage can be viewed on different screen sizes or and is adaptive to any browser it is being viewed on. The webpage is formatted in a way that when viewing on smaller or bigger screens, the webpage is able to adapt.</p>

      <p><strong>What is semantic structure?</strong></p>

        <p>A semantic structure is the foundation of your code - a template. It helps the web browser define what the layout of the content is on the webpage - whether its an image, text, or a heading etc.</p>
